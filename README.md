# Roller Coaster Geometry Shader

### This shader was created using the optional stage of the rendering pipeline, the geometry shader stage. It was inspired by my love for roller ocasters and interest in the maths behind Bezier curves.

## How to build and run the shader:
Download/ fork this github repo then go into :
```
2DAE01_NicoleMunro_GeomShader/Build/Debug
```
And then you can open the .exe from there!


## Controls:
Becuase picking wasn't implemented in the engine as of yet, in order to change and manipulate the Bezier points use the following controls:
```
keypad right: switch between Beziers
keypad left: switch between Bezier points
keypad up: increase segments
keypad down: decrease segments
t : positive x
g : negative x
y : positive y
h : negative y
u : positive z
j : negative z
```
